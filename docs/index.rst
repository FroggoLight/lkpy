=======

LensKit is a set of Python tools for experimenting with and studying recommender
systems.  It provides support for training, running, and evaluating recommender
algorithms in a flexible fashion suitable for research and education.

.. tip::

    To start using LensKit, see :ref:`installation` and then :ref:`getting-started`.

LensKit for Python (also known as LKPY) is the successor to the Java-based
LensKit toolkit and a part of the LensKit project.

.. important::

    If you use LensKit in published research, see the :ref:`citation
    instructions <citation>`, and particularly cite our paper [LKPY]_.

Throughout this documentation, we use the notation of :cite:t:`ekstrand:notation`.

.. versionchanged:: 2025.1

    The LensKit documentation is now split apart for easier readability, with
    the `topical user guide <guide/index>`_ and `API reference <api/index>`_ in
    separate sections.

    There have been significant incompatible changes in LensKit 2025.1.  See the
    :ref:`release notes <2025.1>` and :ref:`migration guide <migrating>`.
